# Typescript Weather App - Week 11 Hackathon
A front end only typescript application that allows users to find the current weather in a given location. It provides the max, min and 'feels like' temperatures.

### Screenshots

### Motivation
This was a task assigned to us to consolidate the two days we spent on typescript. Keelie and I wanted a slick and tidy style.
### Lessons Learned
- How to assign types to props.
- How to handle type annotating types.
- Navigating data in response to a fetch.

### Tech Stack
- React
- Typescript
- CSS

### Improvements
I intend to change the styling over the next couple of days as well as elaborate on the functionality, such as adding a weather image or changing bg based on a particular weather etc...
